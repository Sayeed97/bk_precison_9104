# BK Precision 9103 and 9104

This is a Python library for communicating with the [BK Precision 9103 and 9104][ref1]
power supply via its serial interface. You can control the supply's parameters
and take voltage/current readings.


Please note since the primary purpose of the repository is to remotely (ON/OFF) control the power supply, only those commands have been incorporated for the 9103/9104. The remainder of the commands can be added on a need basis.

Portions of the code have been reused from the repository sampsyo/bkp1696 for a different power supply regulation unit.
